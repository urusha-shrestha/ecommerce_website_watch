				<div>
					<p>The impact that tech-savy costomers have on ecommerce are faster and stronger than ever. As technology changes business-to-costumer transactions, new oppotunities emerge for both sides. Consumers have access to a wide range of benefits from being able to gauge prices to locating stores, finding aternatives and receicing coupons as well. Retailers also have benefits as well, as they can build stronger connection with their customers and develop their brands faster.<br><br>Websites and apps are now provinding retailers an opportunity to connect with theor customers beyond the boundaries of a brick wall. They no longer have to wait for customers to walk into their shops or spot an ad that prompts them to engage with the business.Now, businesses can reach consumers everywhere. Even when customers aren't shopping, retailers can still be on their minds. The constant presence of a brand’s app on a customer's phone reminds him or her that that brand is out there, as an option. What’s more, location-enabled interactions, which deliver messages to customers who enter shops, are getting customers offline back into actual stores.Promotions that once got filtered out by spam detectors or were scrolled over by consumers can now grab a user's attention right at his or her home screen.<br><br>To better serve customers, ecommerce sites are finding they must adapt to the new customer service standards set by technological improvements. This means servicing customers on the various channels they have access to. Brand websites, email, Facebook, Twitter and even Instagram are all being used by customers to connect with brands.Today’s ecommerce sites have to use these platforms to connect with customers, as well.</p>

				  <p>E-commerce can reduce costs for consumers when companies cut down on middlemen involved in distributing goods, warehouse space to store the goods and personnel expenses. E-commerce also enables companies to manage their inventory better. To be competitive, businesses are likely to pass down at least some of these savings to consumers.<br><br>Another positive effect of the emergence of e-commerce is that it may save energy. Consumers who shop online rather than drive to stores use less fuel and their cars emit less pollution. Also, because e-commerce reduces the need for warehouse space to house goods near retail stores, these warehouses use less energy.<br><br>Overall, the future for small businesses looks increasingly bright for those jumping into the ecommerce market.Startups are popping up across the country faster than ever before. Social media, mobile, and cloud technology are enhancing entrepreneurs' ability to get businesses off the ground faster. </p>

				<h2 style="color: white; margin-left: 20px;">Negative Impacts of Technology </h2>
				<div>
					<p>Implementing advanced technologies in a business is a bit expensive because it involves initial purchasing costs, maintenance costs and training-expenses. Technological-systems require periodical updates which need continued investment. All in all, any technological integration within a company will require a network-infrastructure and technological tools like computers, telephones and a lot more which are very costly.<br><br>With use of technology in businesses, there has been an increased risk of cyber crime whereby some malicious people are stealing business and consumer information thus costing companies millions of dollars.In fact, several businesses operating online have lost a lot of money during online-transaction to hackers and that’s why most online-based companies today are investing a lot of in implementing secure online-systems. However, small-businesses may not afford costly effective online security software which implies that they will have to bare with several online security risks.<br><br>Technology offers various forms of entertainment which act as a distraction to employees leading to a reduction in productivity-levels within a company. For example, things like; online-games, music, videos and chatting-platform tend to consume a lot of employee working-time.Technology actually eliminates the use of many employees with a company and it even disconnects the few employees within a company because they tend to use emails, texts and instant-messages for communication instead of person-to-person communication.</p>

				<div class="panel">
				  <p>The use of technology through social-media makes it very difficult for businesses to gain control over customer-issues because customers have more power to express negativity to the public leading to faster spreading of negative-publicity about a given business and it s even very hard to rectify negative comments of customers online since they tend to share them continuously. This can actually negatively impact any business in the long-run and even lead collapse.<br><br>Technology is business is very good but some employees tend to over rely on business-technologies to complete tasks and this can actually lead to missed errors that may have been rectified if a task was done manually. Additionally, businesses that function completely on technological-tools cant process orders or do anything incase their servers fail or a factories may have to halt production of products if a robotic-system break-down hence affecting the production process.</p>
